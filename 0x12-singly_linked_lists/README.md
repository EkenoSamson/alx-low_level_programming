## 0x12-singly-linked-lists

They are linked lists that allow only forward navigation.

## Key characteristics of singly linked lists:

+ Sequential Access: Elements are accessed sequentially, starting from the head and following the pointers to reach specific nodes.

+ Insertions and Deletions: Inserting or deleting a node in a singly linked list usually involves changing a few pointers, making these operations efficient when you have a reference to the node you want to modify.

+ Dynamic Sizing: Singly linked lists can grow or shrink in size as needed by allocating or deallocating memory for nodes.

+ No Random Access: Unlike arrays, singly linked lists do not support direct random access to elements by index. You must traverse the list from the head to find a specific element.
