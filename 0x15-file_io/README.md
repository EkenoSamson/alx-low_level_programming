## C - File I/O and File Descriptors

A single C file can read, write, create and move files in our devices using 
functions included in C file handling I/O.
Data can be manipulated in a file regardless of whether the file is a text or 
binary. The folowing functions are used:
	+ fopen() - opening
	+ fclose() - closing
	+ fgets() / fscanf() - Reading
	+ fputs() / fprintf() - Writng
	+ fseek() / rewind() - move cursor position
