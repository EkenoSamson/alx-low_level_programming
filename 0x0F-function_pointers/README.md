## FUNCTION POINTER

While a pointer to a variable/object is used to accesss them indirectly, 
a pointer to a function is used to invoke a function indirectly.
It is possible to take the address of a function. Similar to arrays, functions 
decay to pointers when their names are used. If you would want the address of 
a function, you would use either function or &function.
